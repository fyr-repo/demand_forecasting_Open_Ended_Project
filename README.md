# Server Demand Forecasting for Dynamically Scaling Container Parameters

The objective of this open-ended project was to develop a scaling engine to effectively scale quantity and parameters of a container/pod inside a kubernetes cluster based on demand forecasting methods using LSTM RNN learning method.

The open-ended nature of this project required the need to formulate a problem statement, find appropriate resources and datasets, create a project plan, execute and present it under the supervision. 

This repository consists of the jupyter notebooks that were written to analyse the model.

Dataset Used: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/3QBYB5
Techstack Used: Python, MySQL, Dask, Pandas, Numpy, SciKit Learn, Keras, Kubernetes Engine (Docker, MiniKube)

Huge Thanks to [Dr. Arka Prokash Mazumdar](https://mnit.ac.in/dept_cse/profile?fid=RKWI) for his supervision throughout this project.
